Description: Offers validation of personal risk models using a random sample or two-stage sample of censored cohort data. We assume that the user has created a risk model that assigns risk to each subject in the cohort data set.  This risk is the probability that the subject suffers a specific adverse outcome within a given time period, the duration of the study.  'rmap' allows the user to compare assigned risks to subsequent outcome by supplying for data broken down into risk groups an attribute diagram, a Hosmer-Lemshow Chi-squared statistic, an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) estimate, and a Standard Deviation (SD) estimate.  Bootstrapping, which accommodates two-stage sampling if appropriate, is offered as an alternative to theoretical variances of various estimates.  New to v0.01-02 are the Individualized Attribute Diagram (IAD),  Case Risk Percentiles (CRPs), and AUC which do not depend on the data broken down into risk groups. New to v0.01-05 are score_statistics, standardized_residuals, and risk_quantile_boxplot.
