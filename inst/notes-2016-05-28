In the file stanford-dot-edu-ggong/index.Rmd, I changed the title to this:

title: "rmap---v-0.01-07---2016-05-23 15:39:54 PDT---We are currently working on rmap version v-0.01-08 which will include code for estimating the concordance of a risk model with outcomes observed in cohort studies with censored times to outcome"

When I come back to this, I plan on changing the version to the one below and implement Erin's changes.

Version: 0.01-08
